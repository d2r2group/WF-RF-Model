# Work Function Random Forest Model

The module contains the random forest ML model to predict the work function of metallic surfaces 
with physics-based descriptors accompanying the publication.<br>
The ML model was trained on a work function database generated by high-throughput density 
functional theory, which can be found here: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10381506.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10381506) <br>
Please, cite the following paper if you use the model in your research:

## Installation

The Python module can be installed by following these steps: 
1. Clone the repository 
2. Run `pip install .` in the repository base folder.
3. Download file `RF_1691469908.2138267.joblib` from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10449568.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10449568) and move it to the `WF-RF-Model` folder (same folder as file `main.py`).


## Usage

The model can be easily initialized and used to predict the work function 
(of the top surface of the slab) as follows (assuming, for example, 
you have a slab stored in file `slab.cif`:

```Python
from wfrfmodel import WFRFModel
from pymatgen.core import Structure

slab = Structure.from_file('slab.cif')

WFModel = WFRFModel()
print(WFModel.predict_work_function(slab)) 
```
