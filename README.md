# Work Function Random Forest Model

The module contains the random forest ML model to predict the work function of metallic surfaces with physics-based descriptors accompanying the publication. 
The ML model was trained on a work function database generated by high-throughput density functional theory, which can be found here: [zenodo](). 
Please, cite the following paper if you use the model in your research:


## Installation

The Python module can be installed by cloning the repository and then running `pip install setup.py` in the repository folder.

## Usage

The model can be easily initialized and used to predict the work function as follows:

```Python
from WF-RF-Model import WFRFModel

slab = Structure.from_file('slab.cif')

WFModel = WFRFModel()
print(WFModel.predict_work_function(slab1)) 
```
